## Step 1: Name Your Business ✍️
Kids invent a business:
- Ice Cream Shop 🍦  
- Pet Salon 🐾  
- Space Travel Company 🚀  
- Video Game Studio 🎮  

Write it down: *“We are the Galactic Donut Shop.”*  
👉 Bonus: draw a logo.

## Step 2: Identify Your Crown Jewels 💎
Ask: *“What’s the most important stuff our business needs to keep safe?”*  

Examples:
- Recipes  
- Customer names  
- Shop tablet  
- Game designs  

Circle or list 3–5 “assets.”

## Step 3: Spot the Villains 👾
Bad guys want to steal, break, or trick us.  

Pick villains:
- **Password Pirate** → steals weak passwords  
- **Phishy Fish** → sends fake links  
- **Virus Vulture** → sneaks into devices  

Write villains next to the assets they’d attack.

---

## Step 4: Build Your Defenses 🛡️
For each villain, pick a defense:
- Password Pirate → use long, strong passwords  
- Phishy Fish → don’t click strange links  
- Virus Vulture → keep devices updated  

Parents: explain each one in kid-friendly words.

## Step 5: Run a Cyber Drill 🚨
Parent says: *“Oh no, Virus Vulture attacked the shop tablet!”*  

Kids respond with 4 moves:
1. **Detect** – “We saw the problem!”  
2. **Respond** – “Shut it down or log out.”  
3. **Recover** – “Turn it back on safely or restore from backup.”  
4. **Lessons Learned** – “Next time, keep updates on.”  

Keep it short, fun, and dramatic 🎭.
